* Which commands are executed.

We do not collect any information about image names, paths, etc. Read our [privacy statement](https://privacy.microsoft.com/privacystatement) to learn more. If you donâ€™t wish to send usage data to Microsoft, you can set the `telemetry.enableTelemetry` setting to `false`.
