# This workflow will build and push an application to a Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster when you push your code
#
# This workflow assumes you have already created the target AKS cluster and have created an Azure Container Registry (ACR)
# For instructions see:
#   - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/kubernetes-walkthrough-portal
#   - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-registry/container-registry-get-started-portal
#   - https://github.com/Azure/aks-create-action
#
# To configure this workflow:
#
# 1. Set the following secrets in your repository (instructions for getting these
#    https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/github/connect-from-azure?tabs=azure-cli%2Clinux)):
#    - AZURE_CLIENT_ID
#    - AZURE_TENANT_ID
#    - AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID
#
# 2. Set the following environment variables (or replace the values below):
#    - AZURE_CONTAINER_REGISTRY (name of your container registry / ACR)
#    - CONTAINER_NAME (name of the container image you would like to push up to your ACR)
#    - RESOURCE_GROUP (where your cluster is deployed)
#    - CLUSTER_NAME (name of your AKS cluster)
#    - IMAGE_PULL_SECRET_NAME (name of the ImagePullSecret that will be created to pull your ACR image)
#
# 3. Choose the appropriate render engine for the bake step https://github.com/Azure/k8s-bake. The config below assumes Helm.
#    Set your helmChart, overrideFiles, overrides, and helm-version to suit your configuration.
#    - CHART_PATH (path to your helm chart)
#    - CHART_OVERRIDE_PATH (path to your helm chart with override values)
