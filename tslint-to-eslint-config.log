4 ESLint rules behave differently from their TSLint counterparts:
  * prefer-arrow/prefer-arrow-functions:
    - ESLint (eslint-plugin-prefer-arrow plugin) does not support allowing named functions defined with the function keyword.
  * @typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars:
    - Please read the following article as the rule behaviour may change on the short term: https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/issues/1856
  * no-underscore-dangle:
    - Leading or trailing underscores (_) on identifiers will now be forbidden.
  * prefer-template:
    - Single concatenations will no longer be ignored.

3 rules are not known by tslint-to-eslint-config to have ESLint equivalents:
  * tslint-to-eslint-config does not know the ESLint equivalent for TSLint's "skipLibCheck".
  * tslint-to-eslint-config does not know the ESLint equivalent for TSLint's "switch-final-break".
  * tslint-to-eslint-config does not know the ESLint equivalent for TSLint's "whitespace".
