Once on this page, you can click any of the models to open up the side panel, which will present you with the option to either **Deploy Default workspace CRD** or **Customize Workspace CRD**. 

Click **Deploy Default workspace CRD** to deploy the model. It will track the progress of the model and notify you once the model has been successfully deployed. It will also notify you if the model was already previously unsucessfully onto your cluster.

Click **Customize Workspace CRD** to open up a CRD file pre-populated with the infromation necessary to deploy the model. You can alter this file to your desires and save it locally.
